Welcome to the IntvalPy documentation! This Python module implements an algebraically closed system
for working with intervals, and provides the ability to work with both classical interval arithmetic
and full Kaucher interval arithmetic. The top-level functionality of the IntvalPy library implements
the latest methods for recognizing and evaluating sets of solutions to interval linear systems
of equations, calculating their formal solutions, and visualizing sets of solutions to interval
equations and systems of equations.
